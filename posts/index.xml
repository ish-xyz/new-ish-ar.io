      <description>Tutorial introduction and requirements Today&amp;rsquo;s article is a tutorial on how set up and use the go-git library to clone and update a repository with an in-memory filesystem.This procedure is quite useful if you want to push against or clone a repository without touching the OS filesystem and deal with permissions or temporary files.Albeit, there&amp;rsquo;s documentation about git-go, I find it not really clear and sometimes misleading due to the different versions and names of the library.</description>

      <description>1. A big single state file is not going to help you. When a new user starts with Terraform, it could seem easier to manage all the infrastructure code under one big repository and one big state file (To who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what a state file is, check out this page -&amp;gt; https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/index.html)
However, this design will soon show its downsides and limits.
Why is a mono state file, not a good idea in terms of performance?</description>
